This project is a basic Spotify Web Player UI clone created using HTML and CSS. It includes a sidebar with navigation options, a library section, a main content area with music cards, a sticky top navigation bar, and a footer-style music player similar to the real Spotify layout. While building this project, I practiced using Flexbox for layout design, worked with Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons, and learned how to style components like cards, buttons, and progress bars. I also explored creating reusable UI sections, handling responsiveness with media queries, and organizing assets properly. This project helped me understand how a modern music streaming interface is structured and styled using only front-end basics.
